A YouTube bot coded in python

https://www.github.com/sryu1/YouTube_View_Bot

This bot is created for educational purposes, for people to download and play around and experiment with the codes.

WARNING! USE THIS BOT IN YOUR OWN RISK, I CANNOT DO ANYTHING IF YOU GET BANNED BY YOUTUBE OR ANYTHING SIMILAR. THE BOT
WILL ONLY WORK WITH ONLY ONE IP ADDRESS, YOUR LOCAL IP ADDRESS.

To run bot, open Run Bot.bat - You may need to add python to PATH. 
To run the GUI (Graphical User Interface) version of the bot, open Run GUI Bot.bat - You may need to add python to path
You are required to click "Enter" after entering the values for each textbox.
If you already have the modules downloaded and installed (selenium and flask), you can just open Bot.py or GUI Bot.py.
The bot status, open another terminal to the same folder and type
"python Bot Status\Bot Status.py" this should give you an ip address and with a port number. If you click on the link,
it will open a browser with some information about the bot. If you would like to see an updated version of the stats,
you must exit the bot status python file and reopen it. Make sure your chromedriver version is the same as you Chrome
browser version.

Use "killprocess.bat" if you have any errors with chrome drivers. THIS WILL CLOSE ALL CHROMEDRIVER INSTANCES!

Please note that the watch time you have entered will apply to the last browser tab opened. For example, if you select 4
views and 2 tabs with a watch time of 2 minutes, both videos will refresh when the second video reaches 2 minutes so if
the video is 2:01 long, the first video might change videos, and it will refresh in a different video which you wouldn't
want happening.

When the bot opens new browser tabs, it will go from a range of different websites to the provided link. This is because
it can improve the video analytics of traffic history.
