## A YouTube bot coded in python

https://www.github.com/sryu1/YouTube_View_Bot

This bot is created for educational purposes, for people to download and play around and experiment with the codes.

WARNING! USE THIS BOT IN YOUR OWN RISK, I CANNOT DO ANYTHING IF YOU GET BANNED BY YOUTUBE OR ANYTHING SIMILAR. THE BOT WILL ONLY WORK WITH ONLY ONE IP ADDRESS, YOUR LOCAL IP ADDRESS.


To run the bot, First, open setup.py to install necessary modules. You may need to add python to PATH.
After that, open Bot.py and follow the instructions prompted by the bot.
To run the GUI (Graphical User Interface) version of the bot, open GUI.py.
You are required to click "Enter" after entering the values for each textbox.

Use "killprocess.bat" if you have any errors with chrome drivers. THIS WILL CLOSE ALL CHROMEDRIVER INSTANCES!

PLEASE NOTE that the watch time you have entered will apply to the last browser tab opened. For example, if you select 4 views and 2 tabs with a watch time of 2 minutes, both videos will refresh when the second video reaches 2 minutes so if the video is 2:01 long, the first video might change videos, and it will refresh in a different video which you wouldn't want happening.

When the bot opens new browser tabs, it will go from a range of different websites to the provided link. This is because it can improve the video analytics of traffic history.
