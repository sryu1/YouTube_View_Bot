This bot is created for educational purposes, for people to download and play around and experiment with the codes.

WARNING! USE THIS BOT IN YOUR OWN RISK, I CANNOT DO ANYTHING IF YOU GET BANNED BY YOUTUBE OR ANYTHING SIMILAR.
THE BOT WILL ONLY WORK WITH ONLY ONE IP ADDRESS, YOUR LOCAL IP ADDRESS.

Easiest way to run bot: open Runbot.bat- you will need to have python on path.

General method:

To run the bot, open terminal (cmd) and type "cd your_view_bot_folder_directory" note that your_view_bot_folder_
directory is where you put the directory of you view bot folder. Remember to install the modules by using 
"pip install requirements.txt" After that, enter "python Bot.py" this should start up
the bot and enter details as requested by the bot. The bot status, open another terminal to the same folder and type
"python Bot Status\Bot Status.py" this should give you an ip address and with a port number. If you click on the link,
it will open a browser with some information about the bot. If you would like to see an updated version of the stats, 
you must exit the bot status python file and reopen it. 

Please note that the watch time you have entered will apply to the last browser tab opened. For example, if you select 4
views and 2 tabs with a watch time of 2 minutes, both videos will refresh when the second video reaches 2 minutes so if
the video is 2:01 long, the first video might change videos and it will refresh in a different video which you wouldn't 
want happening.

When the bot opens new browser tabs, it will go from a range of different websites to the provided link. This is because
it can improve the video analytics of traffic history.
